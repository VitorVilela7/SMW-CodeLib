When contributing, keep in mind the following:

1) While using standardized code is recommended (similar to e.g. shared library on GPS/GIEPY/UberASM/etc.),
the main focus is for copy/pasting or editing code for further usage on a certain work.

2) Make pull requests as soon as you finish editing a certain file to reduce chance of eventual conflicts
with other forks, in case this repository gets fairly popular or in case you're editing multiple files.
