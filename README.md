# SMW-CodeLib
Repository for storing common/shared useful codes for SMW modding.

While using standardized is recommended (similar to e.g. shared library on GPS/GIEPY/UberASM/etc.),
the main focus is for copy/pasting or editing code for further usage on a certain work.

Feel free to contribute at will! The more, the better.
